# ReverseGoogle - The Opposite Search Engine

ReverseGoogle is a comically wrong search engine that returns the exact opposite or most absurd result for any user query. Instead of providing accurate results like a normal search engine, ReverseGoogle delivers ironic, opposite, or completely off-topic answers — confidently and creatively.

## Features

- Takes a user's search input and matches it to a predefined or dynamically generated opposite (e.g., "love" → "hate", "cat" → "dog")
- Displays the "reverse result" in a mock-search format with titles, descriptions, and fake links
- UI designed to look like a legitimate search engine but filled with nonsense or reversed data
- Humorous touches like "Did you mean: something entirely different?" suggestions
- Fake confidence indicators: "100% matched result (not really)"

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Enter a search query in the search box
3. Click the search button or press Enter
4. Enjoy the absurd, opposite results!

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML structure of the application
- `styles.css` - CSS styling for the search engine interface
- `script.js` - JavaScript code that handles the search functionality and generates the comically wrong results

## How It Works

The application uses a dictionary of opposites and related terms to find the reverse of your search query. If no direct opposite is found, it will generate a random unrelated term. The results are presented in a familiar search engine format but with completely unhelpful information.

## Customization

You can extend the dictionary of opposites in the `script.js` file to add more terms and their opposites. You can also modify the categories, fake domains, and description templates to create even more varied and humorous results.
