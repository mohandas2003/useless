Project Description
[This project, ReverseGoogle, is a humorous search engine that intentionally gives the opposite or most absurd results for any query.
Instead of accurate answers, it shows funny ‚ÄúDid you mean‚Ä¶‚Äù suggestions, fake URLs, and comically wrong descriptions for entertainment.]

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[The ‚Äúproblem‚Äù I‚Äôm solving is that traditional search engines give you exactly what you‚Äôre looking for ‚Äî how boring!
ReverseGoogle fixes this by making sure you **never** find the right answer, replacing it with absurd, irrelevant, and hilariously wrong results so you can enjoy confusion and laughter instead of information.
]

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[The solution is **ReverseGoogle** ‚Äî a search engine that proudly ignores your query and delivers the exact opposite or most ridiculous answer possible.
With fake URLs, nonsense descriptions, and absurd ‚ÄúDid you mean‚Ä¶‚Äù suggestions, it transforms the act of searching into a comedy show nobody asked for, but everyone secretly needs.

*Caption: Conceptual schematic of the ReverseGoogle system ‚Äî the user provides input via keyboard or microphone, which is handled by JavaScript event listeners. The query is processed through the opposite word mapping dictionary, then passed to the fake result generator. Generated results are rendered using HTML and CSS for display, while optional APIs like the Web Speech API and LocalStorage handle voice recognition, settings, and history storage.*
